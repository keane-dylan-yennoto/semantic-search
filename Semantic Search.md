**Semantic Search** is a search engine technology that interprets the exact meaning of words and phrases.

The results of the search will return content **matching the meaning** of the query, instead of the ~~content~~ that literally matches the words in the query

Semantic search is a **set of search engine capabilities**, which includes :

- understanding words from the searcherâ€™s intent
- their search context.

This type of search is intended to improve the quality of search results by interpreting natural language more accurately and in context. 

Semantic search achieves this by matching search intent to semantic meaning with the help of technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.

summary:

Semantic Search is a search engine technology that searches the database of by the meaning of the query instead of the literal matches of the word.

This type of search understands the words of the searcher in their search context.

## How it works

Semantic search is powered by **vector search**.

Before we dive into vector search we must know what vector embedding is.
